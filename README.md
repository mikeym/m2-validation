# m2-validation

## Synopsis

These components are intended to make it easier to show field validation states in AngularJS projects that use Bootstrap for styling. See the individual projects for more information.
  
* [show-validation-icon](/validation-icon/) is a directive that conditionally displays a small validation icon at the right of text-based input fields.

More coming, stay tuned...

## Contributors

These are little side projects from Mikey Micheletti ([@mikeym](https://twitter.com/mikeym)) in Seattle. I write articles every so often on [deepgraysea.com](http://deepgraysea.com) and you can also contact me there. This is my first attempt at creating open-source components from scratch so let me know how I can do better. Thanks!
